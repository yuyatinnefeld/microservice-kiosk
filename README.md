# Microservice Kiosk üç¨
Welcome to the Microservice Kiosk project! This repository is a hands-on exploration of modern cloud-native technologies, including ArgoCD, Istio as a service mesh, HashiCorp Vault, Terraform, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and more. The goal is to deepen understanding and practical experience with these tools in a microservices architecture. In a typical microservices architecture, each service is often stored in its own repository. However, for the purpose of this project, I have consolidated all important source code into one repo to simplify management.
